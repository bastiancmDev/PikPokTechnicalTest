# PikPokTechnicalTest
Unity technical test for PIKPOKGAMES.
By [Sebastian Chavez Murillo]

## Description
Turn-based game in which you control a player and face 3 enemies to be defeated through strategic decision-making between Attack and Defend, using consumable items from the inventory.

## Usage instructions

When you open the file named 'TTest' in the folder named 'BUILD' or download the .exe from the following address [url(https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/p5y4rxwy9b4y299uiero6/BuildTTPIKPOK.rar?rlkey=q19b5n97xhc2g2ts16a8ipo0k&dl=0 )], you will encounter a black menu with two buttons. Only the 'NEW GAME' button is functional for now. It takes you to a world where you can navigate by clicking. When you come within 10 units of an enemy, a battle mode activates, displaying an interface for attacking or defending. It's a turn-based combat system. You can use the inventory to strengthen your character. When you manage to defeat all 3 enemies, a victory message will be displayed. If your character dies, you'll see a defeat message.
